=============================================================================

SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE:
Blueprint of the application workflow.

TYPES:
1. ONE-TIER ARCHITECTURE
2. TWO-TIER ARCHITECTURE
3. THREE-TIER ARCHITECTURE
4. N-TIER ARCHITECTURE

TIER = LAYER = SERVER

SERVER: to serve the services to end user.

1. web server  : presentation layer
2. app server  : business/logic layer
3. db server   : data server


WEB SERVER: httpd
AKA	  : the presentation layer
Purpose   : to show the app
Who	  : UI/UX (front-end dev)
What	  : Web Technologies
EX	  : html, css, js


APP SERVER: tomcat
AKA	  : Business/Logic layer
Purpose	  : to use the app
Who       : Backend Dev
What	  : Programming languages
Ex        : java, python, c, c++, .net


DB SERVER: mysql
AKA       : data server
Purpose   : to store & retrieve data
Who	  : DBA/DBD
What      : DB languages
Ex	  : mysql, mssql, postgres, arango, oracle ---



1. ONE-TIER ARCHITECTURE : (STANDALONE APP)
ALL 3 LAYERS WILL BE ON LOCAL.
HERE THE APP WILL WORK ON OUR LAPTOP.
IT DOESN'T REQ INTERNET CONNECTION.

EX: VLC 

2. TWO-TIER ARCHITECTURE : (CLIENT-SERVER APP)
WEB & APP = LOCAL 
DB = INTERNET
IT REQ INTERNET CONNECTION.

EX: BANKING APPS

3. THREE-TIER ARCHITECTURE : (WEB APP)
APP NEED NOT TO INSTALL
WE CAN USE ANY APP FROM THE INTERNET

EX: ALL THE APP
=====================================================================================
SERVER: Serves the services to end user.
it will take request from user and send response.


PHYSICAL SERVERS:
 
1. It will consume space
2. 24/7 electricity
3. maintenance

CLOUD SERVERS:
AWS
AZURE
GCP

AWS : AMAZON WEB SERVICES
SERVER: EC2 -- > ELASTIC COMPUTE CLOUD


TO CREATE SERVER ON AWS, IT WILL TAKE 7 STEPS

1. NAME & TAGS : 

2. AMI : AMAZON MACHINE IMAGE
   WE HAVE OS, SOFTWARE PKGS

3. INSTANCE TYPE: CPU & MEMORY
   T2.MICRO : 1 CPU & 1 RAM 

4. KEYPAIR: USED TO LOGIN 
   HERE WE HAVE 2 KEYS 
   1. PUBLIC KEY   : AWS
   2. PRIVATE KEY  : USER   (PEM, PPK)

5. NETWORK: 
   VPC : PRIVACY & SECURITY FOR SERVER
   SG  : TO ACCESS THE APPLICATIONS (PORTS : 0 - 65535)

6. STORAGE: EBS VOLUME
   TO PROVIDE STORAGE FOR THE SERVER 
   DEFAULT: 8GB   MAX: 16 TB

7. summary



LINUX:
It is an os -- > Blender

os: Operating system: 
its a software used to communicate with systems.

Linux is a Kernel.
Kernel: it is lowest level of operating system.


WHY WE NEED TO LEARN LINUX:
1. TOP 500 SUPER COMPUTERS
2. 96% SERVERS
3. 86% mobiles
4. Electronic Gadgets

ADVANTAGES:
1. FREE AND OPEN-SOURCE
2. SECURITY WILL BE HIGH
3. HIGH PERFORMANCE
4. MULTI USER BASED
5. IT SUPPORTS ALL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
6. HIGH SPEED

COMPONENTS:
1. SHELL: deal with input & outputs.
2. DAEMON: deal with background processs.
3. Kernel: deals with hardware. (cpu, ram, rom)

FLAVOURS/DISTRIBUTION:
IPHONE15 -- > 15 + -- > 15 PRO -- > PRO MAX

UBUNTU   : 70%
REDHAT
CENTOS
FEDORA
DEBIAN
ROCKY LINUX
KALI LINUX
ALMA LINUX
