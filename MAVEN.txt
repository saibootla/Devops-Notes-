MAVEN:

raw chicken -- >  clean  --> marnet -- > ingredients -- > Chicken Biryani
raw code    -- > build   -- > test  -- > artifact -- > Deployment

ARTIFACT: its final product of our code.
developers will give raw code that code we are going to convert into artifact.

TYPES:
1. jar	: Java Archive       : Backend code
2. war	: Web Archive	     : Frontend code + Backend code
3. ear	: Enterprise Archive : jar + war 

JAR FILE:

.java -- > compile -- > .class -- > .jar file

.java	: basic raw
.class	: executable file
.jar	: artifact

all the artifacts are going to created by a build too1.

MAVEN:
Maven is the build tool.
its a free and opensource.
build: process of adding the libs & dependencies to code.
its is also called as Project management too1.
it will manage the complete structure of the project.
the main file in the maven tool is POM.XML

POM.XML: its a file which consist of complete project information.
Ex: name, artifact, tools, libs, dep --------

POM: PROJECT OBJECT MODEL
XML: EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE

WHO GIVE POM.XML : DEVELOPERS
dev will give both code and pom.xml in github

maven is written on java by apache software foundation.
supports: JAVA-1.8.0
year: 2004
home path: .m2


PRATCICAL PART:
1. CREATE AN EC2 INSTANCE AND CONNECT
2. yum install git java-1.8.0-openjdk maven tree -y
3. git clone https://github.com/devopsbyraham/jenkins-java-project.git
4. cd jenkins-java-project


MAVEN LIFECYCLE:
GOALS : a command used to run a task.
Goals refers pom.xml to execute.


PLUGIN: its a small software which makes our work automated.
insted of downloading tools we can donwload plugins.
this plugins will donwload automatically when we run goals.



1. mvn compile : y.java [src] -- > .class [target])
2. mvn test    : used to test the code    (.java [test] -- > .class [target])
3. mvn package : used to create artifact 
4. mvn install : used to copy artifact to .m2 (project folder -- > .m2)
5. mvn clean   : to delete the target folder
6. mvn clean package: compile -- > install


PROBLEMS WITHOUT MAVEN:
1. we cant create artifacts.
2. We cant create project structure.
3. we cant build and deploy the apps.

ALTERNATIVIES:
MAVEN, ANT, GRADLE 

MAVEN VS ANT:
1. MAVEN IS BUILD & PROJECT MANAGEMNT, ANT IS ONLY BUILD TOOL
2. MAVEN HAS POM.XML, ANT HAS BUILD.XML
3. MAVEN HAS A LIFECYCLE, ANT WILL NOT HAVE LIFECYCLE
4. MAVEN PLUGINS ARE REUSABLE, ANT SCRIPTS ARE NOT RESUEABLE.
5. MAVEN IS DECLARATIVE, ANT IS PROCEDURAL.

PROGRAMMING VS BUILD:

JAVA	: MAVEN
PYTHON	: GRADLE
.NET	: VS CODE
C, C#	: MAKE FILE
node.js	: npm --> package.json --> npm install

ALTERNETIAVES: 
ANT, GRADLE for java projects.
